# How to Run

Run **test.py** this contains the test cases for the algorithm, **unique.py** is the main algorithm </br>

# Explanation

The idea is to use a dictionary to count how many characters appear in the string, if there is more than one character then that character is not repeated anymore. <br> 

# Time/Space complexity

- Would be **O(N)** because we are iterating in the entire string, N would be the string length. <br>
- For **space complexity** would be **O(N)** because we are saving as many elements in the dictionary as the string length. <br>
